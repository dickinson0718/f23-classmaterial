### Regret Policy

I recognize that courses can be stressful and occasional lapses of judgement
occur where students commit an academic integrity violation and regret it shortly
after. In order to create an environment where you can take responsibility for
your actions, this course will have a "regret policy". Within 48 hours of
the due date for an activity/lab or within 48 hours of completing an exam, you can
withdraw your submission if after contemplation you believe you may have committed
academic misconduct. To do so, you must inform me in via email or private Piazza
note within 48 hours of the due date / late deadline including the following text:

> I wish to invoke the regret clause for [ASSESSMENT NAME].

Upon invoking the regret clause

1. You will need to meet with me so we can talk through what happened. Maybe
   there are bigger issues outside of class that need to be dealt with, maybe
   this wouldn't have actually been an academic integrity violation.
   The point of this meeting is not to
   be scary or a punishment, it's to talk through what happened.
2. You will be withdrawing your submission and as such will
   receive a 0 on the entire assessment.
3. Because you made this decision of your own accord and withdrew your submission,
   this instance will not be considered an academic integrity violation and will
   not be reported to OSCCR (except when there is a clear pattern of repeated
   invocations of this clause).

I will not look at any submissions until 48 hours after the due date / late
deadline / exam completion time.
If the 48 hours have passed and you have not informed me of
your desire to invoke the "regret clause" and I detect academic misconduct, it
will result in disciplinary action, up to failure in the course, and will be
reported to the Office of Student Conduct and Conflict Resolution.
