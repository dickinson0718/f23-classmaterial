### Course Schedule
This table outlines the entire course schedule.  Lecture notes are
posted for each topic.  Lecture videos, although not direct recordings
of this semester's live lectures, cover the same topics and are beneficial
if you are sick or do not feel comfortable attending in person.
Minilab links will be added prior to the start of class.  The dates in this
schedule are tentative and subject to change.
