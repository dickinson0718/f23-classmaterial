## Course Introduction

Programming is a craft, learning to think like a programmer isn’t something you pick up overnight. As in skills like drawing, writing, painting, woodworking, knitting or playing an instrument, dedicating time consistently to practice is an effective way to build aptitude. This course is structured to encourage regular practice through lecture, coding activities, and weekly readings.

## Why Take This Course?

- This course will help strengthen your problem-solving skills.
- Logical reasoning, problem solving and the ability to create new technologies are vital 21st century skills.
- Computing skills can be acquired with practice and study.
- Computing skills apply across disciplines.

## Course Objectives

1. Introduce computer science:
   - Learn simple and structured data types, program control structures, and logic.
   - Perform problem analysis, algorithm design, implementation in a high-level language.
   - Write programs that employ selection, repetition, and functions and that use libraries of numerical and scientific utilities
2. Introduce computational science:
   - Understand the field of study concerned with using computers to analyze, mathematically model, simulate, and solve problems in various scientific disciplines
   - Conduct abstract modeling of complex scientific problems

## Where to Find Help!

Learning to program requires patience, persistence and will certainly be challenging. Know that I am willing to offer advice and guidance throughout the course. Please ask questions before, during and after class as well as visit me during office hours. I am happy to meet at other times as well. You can contact the [GVSU tutoring center](http://www.gvsu.edu/tc/) to request tutoring for this course. There are also regular drop in hours in the [CIS Student Success Center](https://www.gvsu.edu/computing/student-success-center-13.htm).

## Piazza

We will be using Piazza for **all class related communication**.
Please read the [Piazza FAQ](piazza-faq.md) for more details.
In particular, note that important announcements will be posted
to Piazza and you are responsible for monitoring it and
that **all questions and concerns**
should be posted to Piazza (instead of emailed). Emails
will likely be redirected to be posted to Piazza and then
answered there. Piazza is available
both web-based and as a phone app.

## Textbook

No official textbook - the Jupyter notebooks are meant to replace a traditional textbook.
If you prefer to run the Jupyter notebooks in the videos on Google CoLab,
the "Run Online" links posted on
[Python for Applied Computing Github](https://github.com/eecarrier/python-for-applied-computing)
will open them automatically in CoLab. Note: All videos and notebooks of the book can be reached directly from our course instance of PrairieLearn.

Completely Optional (a decent book if you want to a separate resource to follow): _Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python_ by Guttag (2017)

## Flipped Classroom

This course will be run as a flipped classroom. You will be responsible
for watching lecture videos before coming to class. In-class time will be used
for discussion over topics covered in the videos and completing activities,
and working on labs.

The goal of the flipped classroom is so that you can get help when you need it.
With coding, often student's do not realize their misunderstandings until it
comes time to apply the material. So, rather than using class time for lectures,
class time will be devoted to applying the material so that students can get help
when they need it.

This style of classroom will also allow students with various coding backgrounds to move
through the material at (slightly) different rates.

## Grade Breakdown

| Activity       | Percentage | Pairs or Individual?                                   |
| -------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Videos         | 5%         | Individual                                             |
| Activities     | 25%        | Individual, but okay to discuss in general with others |
| Labs           | 25%        | Pairs                                                  |
| Exams          | 25%        | Individual                                             |
| Course Project | 30%        | Your choice                                            |

### Videos (PrairieLearn)

Each week there will be a series of lecture videos and accompanying (Jupyter)
notebooks which cover the
material for that week. You are responsible for watching the videos and
**executing every** cell in each notebook.
The notebooks must be submitted and graded. The percentage of notebooks submitted and graded (for completion and not correctness) will determine this part of your grade.

### Activities (PrairieLearn)

[PrairieLearn](https://prairielearn.engr.illinois.edu/pl/)
will be used for regular, short activities.
The idea of these activities is to allow you to try out
and check your understanding of the material covered in the
lecture videos.
PL is an online system that will allow you to submit your
code for autograding. You will be able to submit, see whether
or not you got it correct, and resubmit
prior to the due date/time to improve your grade
without penalty as
many times as you wish. Unless otherwise stated,
all activities are due at the end of the week on Sunday at 11:59pm.

You should keep trying these activities until you are able
to get them correct. My goal is that
everyone will be able to get full credit for all of these
activities -- the autograder is meant to be a positive that
helps your understanding and grade, not a negative.

### Labs

Friday will be dedicated to completing
labs. The lab task will be available on PrairieLearn at the beginning
of the lab class period. Other lab policies:

- Labs _must_ be completed with your assigned partner.
  Partners will be assigned in the first week based on
  the results of a survey.
- Most labs are designed to be finished during the dedicated
  lab time, assuming you come prepared and have watched the
  video lectures and completed the activities for the week.
  Labs must be completed within 1 week (e.g., before the start of the
  next lab class day).
- When you finish the lab task, let the instructor know so
  you can demo it. If you do not complete it
  in the lab session it is assigned, you may demo during
  office hours, during other activity time during class periods, or during the
  next lab.

### Exams (PrairieLearn)

There will be multiple midterm exams (tentatively week 5 and week 11)
that will be taken on [PrairieLearn](https://prairielearn.engr.illinois.edu/pl/) and consist of both
non-coding (multiple choice, fill-in-the-blank, etc.) questions
and one or more coding questions.

### Course Project

In lieu of a final exam, each student (individually or with
a partner) will complete a culminating project of your choice.
The goal for these projects is that it allows you to bring
together all of the knowledge and skills covered throughout
the course and to apply them to a discipline you find
interesting. As the course project is a significant portion
of the overall course grade, this
The deliverables for the final project will be:

- A presentation delivered to the class during the final exam
  time period.
- A write-up that will contain your code, results, etc.
  This will be a jupyter notebook.

In addition to these deliverables, there will be 2 intermediate,
short, check-in assignments.

- Project Ideas: A short list of 3 potential project ideas.
  Each idea only needs to be 1-2 sentences. This will be
  submitted in week 4 (exact due date TBA). This is just
  to make sure you are thinking about the project -- you
  are free to choose an idea other than one of the 3 you
  submit.
- Project Proposal: A 1 paragraph description of the
  chosen project and the work that has been done so far.
  There is no set amount of work that has to be done by
  this point, but there should be enough done to identify
  any early issues. This will be submitted in week 9
  (exact due date TBA). The purpose of this is to
  make sure that you:

  1. have not simply forgotten about the course project
  2. have started looking into it enough to evaluate
     whether it is feasible

The final, completed course projects will be due at the start
of our scheduled final exam time.
In addition to your project, you are expected to be paying attention
to other student's project presentations.

The project is your opportunity to show me what you've learned. Combining
code from multiple online resources or simply following a tutorial is not an acceptable
project. Showing me what you can do is more important that creating a flashy project.
I encourage you to push your boundaries, but projects that are clearly well-beyond
what is reasonable given your other work in the course are frequently an indication
of academic misconduct.

## Grading Scale

Because this course has a mix of undergraduate and graduate students,
there are two different grading scales.

### Undergraduate Students

| % Range   | Grade | % Range  | Grade | % Range  | Grade |
| --------- | ----- | -------- | ----- | -------- | ----- |
| [93, 100] | A     | [90, 93) | A-    |          |       |
| [87, 90)  | B+    | [83, 87) | B     | [80, 83) | B-    |
| [77, 80)  | C+    | [73, 77) | C     | [70, 73) | C-    |
| [67, 70)  | D+    | [63, 67) | D     | [0, 63)  | F     |

### Graduate Students

| % Range   | Grade | % Range  | Grade | % Range  | Grade |
| --------- | ----- | -------- | ----- | -------- | ----- |
| [95, 100] | A     | [93, 95) | A-    |          |       |
| [90, 93)  | B+    | [87, 90) | B     | [83, 87) | B-    |
| [81, 83)  | C+    | [79, 81) | C     | [77, 79) | C-    |
| [76, 77)  | D+    | [75, 76) | D     | [0, 75)  | F     |

## Extra Credit

Extra credit will be awarded for good questions (as marked by the
instructor) and good answers (as endorsed by the instructor). The
exact formula is not yet determined, but the extra credit will
be capped at 1% of the overall course grade.

## Course Policies

### University Course Policies

This course is subject to the GVSU policies listed at
[http://www.gvsu.edu/coursepolicies/](http://www.gvsu.edu/coursepolicies/).

### General Course Policies

- If you observe a holiday listed in GVSU’s [interfaith calendar](https://www.gvsu.edu/campusinterfaith/interfaith-calendar-17.htm) and a due date from this course conflicts, please let me know and we can figure out another mutually agreeable due date.
- All activities and assignments must be completed on and submitted in
  [PrairieLearn](https://prairielearn.engr.illinois.edu/pl/).
  Emailed code will not be accepted.
- You get _8_ grace days that you can use during the semester. Grace days can be
  used to turn in a activity or lab -- a grace day. Requests must be made _prior_ to the original due date. 24 hours means 24 hours from the original due date. Late assignments will not be accepted, except in very extenuating circumstances (e.g. extremely severe illness, etc.). This is done
  as the goal of these is to make sure you are keeping up
  with the material.
  - **Here is a strategy to be successful in this course and avoid academic dishonesty:** If you are struggling with a lab or activity, email me or come by during office hours or see me after class. If you didn’t have time to ask questions early and an assignment is due in an hour or two, rather than risk violating the academic honesty policy, just send me an email and ask for a grace day extension. Then you can have more time to think about the problem and talk to me about it.
- Note: You will continue to have access to the assignments after they are due. Any work done on an assignment after the posted due date and time will not be counted for credit unless you are using a grace day. This is done so that you can go back and review your work.
- All labs and activities assigned (i.e. anything assigned in this class) must be completed using the tools (commands, methods, syntax, etc.) outlined and demonstrated in class or in PrairieLearn from sections that are not after the place assigned in the class. If you don’t follow this direction the grade is zero.
- There may be a need for changes to happen midsemester, so this
  information is tentative and the instructor reserves the right to modify
  course policies, the course
  calendar, due dates, number of assignments, etc.

### Academic Honesty Policies

All students are expected to adhere to the academic honesty standards
set forth by Grand Valley State University. In addition, students
in this course are expected to adhere to the [academic honesty
guidelines as set forth by the School of Computing and Information
Systems](https://www.gvsu.edu/computing/academic-honesty-30.htm).

Academic honesty is taken seriously. Penalties may be different for
undergraduate and graduate students. If you have any questions about what is
allowed, it is your responsibility to check with the instructor first.

For this course:

- **Activities**: are to be completed individually. You may discuss the
  activities in general with others, but you should not sharing/copying code.
- **Labs**: your lab should be completed with your assigned
  partner. Code should not be shared among members of different lab groups.
  Each partner should fully understand the code that is turned in for the lab.
- **Projects**: may be completed individually or with a
  partner. While you can discuss your project idea in general with others,
  fundamentally the work you submit for you project must be your own. If working
  with a partner, both partners are expected to understand the project and be
  capable of explaining it.
- **Exams**: Exams are to be completed individually. Exams are open-book,
  open-note, open general internet resources (for something like python documentation).
  You are free to look at the class demos,
  lectures, labs, and activities while taking the exam. You may not attempt to
  find or use a full solution to the problem
  (or a solution to a large component of the problem) online.
  Additionally, you can not
  discuss or share any portion of the exam with another
  individual (whether or not they are taking this class). You are also
  not allowed to benefit from any other student that may have sought outside help.
  Using any unauthorized resource on exams will be considered an academic integrity
  violation and will result in a grade penalty (up to failure in the course) as
  well as be reported to the Office of Student Conduct and Conflict Resolution.

#### Academic Integrity FAQs:

- Can I seek help through sites like upwork? _No, this would generally be
  considered an academic integrity violation_
- Can I have help from a tutor? _You may seek help from a tutor, but the work
  you submit for projects/labs/activities in the end must be your own. You may not consult
  tutors when taking exams._
- Can I use sites like stackoverflow? _Yes, this is allowed in this course,
  so long as you are not simply posting your entire problem and asking
  for a solution and that you do not look for or use a full solution to a large
  portion of the problem (regardless of whether or not you were the one asking).
  Fundamentally the work you submit must be your own._
- Can I use sites like Chegg? _No, this would be considered an academic
  integrity violation, even if you were not the one posting the question_
- Can I just piece together existing code found online for my project? _No,
  this would be considered an academic integrity violation. Fundamentally the
  work you submit must be your own_.

### Pivot To Remote Instruction

If we must switch to remote instruction, many of the course requirements and policies will have to be adapted. Details will be posted at the appropriate time on the course Blackboard site (which you will be required to check daily). If we have switch modes of instruction, I will change to a hybrid instruction model, where classes may be livestreamed, and all students will be required to attend class synchronously or in-person at the regularly scheduled times. Students must meet [GVSU’s minimum technology requirements](https://www.gvsu.edu/online/technology-requirements-for-onlinehybrid-courses-8.htm) for online/hybrid courses.

### Face Covering Policy

This class will follow the guidance of the university regarding face covering usage and definitions. In particular, if the [University’s alert level](https://www.gvsu.edu/lakerstogether/alert-levels-and-indicators-39.htm) rises to 1 or higher, they will be required unless an official exception is granted to a student.

## Special Needs?

If you need accommodations due to a learning, physical, or other disability you must present a memo to me from Disability Support Resources (DSR), indicating the existence of a disability and the suggested reasonable accommodations. If you have not already done so, please contact the Disability Support Resources office (215 CON) by calling 331-2490 or email to dsrgvsu@gvsu.edu. Please note that I cannot provide accommodations based upon disability until I have received a copy of the DSR issued memo. All discussions will remain confidential. Furthermore, if you have a physical disability and think you will need assistance evacuating this classroom and/or building in an emergency situation, please make me aware so I can develop a plan to assist you.

## Classroom and Campus Safety:

I consider classroom and campus safety our shared responsibility. Please familiarize yourself with the classroom emergency placard, which contains important information that could prove useful should an emergency arise. Emergency situations could include a fire alarm, tornado warning, medical emergency, or hostile intruder, and our response might consist of evacuating MAK Hall in an orderly manner, moving as a group to a different location in the building, rendering assistance a class member, or staying put and locking the classroom door. In all cases, I will provide clear instructions as to what you should do. Please make sure to have your primary mobile number listed in Banner so that you will automatically receive any campus alerts. Should you receive an emergency notification in class, notify me immediately.

Additional information about campus safety can be found at the following sites:

- [Directions for enabling additional contact means to the campus alert system](https://www.gvsu.edu/gvsualert)
- [List of campus tornado safety locations](https://www.gvsu.edu/emergency/tornado-safety-location-2.htm)
- [Medical emergencies and campus AED locations](https://www.gvsu.edu/emergency/medical-emergency-15.htm)
- [Active shooter response](https://www.gvsu.edu/dps/active-shooter-response-85.htm)
- Fire: Immediately proceed to the nearest exit during a fire alarm. Do not use elevators. More information is available on the University’s [Emergency website](http://www.gvsu.edu/emergency).

## Finally… Life Happens! and I Care About You

Your health and your family's health should be your priority. If you are dealing with illness, sick family members, travel difficulties, a bad internet connection, increased anxiety, childcare challenges, or any other issues, please reach out and we will figure out accommodations. I care about you, want you to be successful, and I can flex (within reason) on the requirements for this course but only if I know something is going on in your life.
